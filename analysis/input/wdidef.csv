EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3,"PM2.5 air pollution, mean annual exposure (micrograms per cubic meter)","Population-weighted exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution is defined as the average level of exposure of a nation's population to concentrations of suspended particles measuring less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter, which are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and causing severe health damage. Exposure is calculated by weighting mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 by population in both urban and rural areas.","Brauer, M. et al. 2017, for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017."
SH.STA.AIRP.P5,"Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution, age-standardized (per 100,000 population)","Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution is the number of deaths attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution in a year per 100,000 population. The rates are age-standardized.

NY.GDP.PCAP.CD,GDP per capita (current US$),GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.,"World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files."
NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG,GDP per capita growth (annual %),Annual percentage growth rate of GDP per capita based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2010 U.S. dollars. GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.
